\section*{Introduction}
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
Modern cities deploy a wide range of interconnected sensors to gather valuable data about traffic, air quality, waste management, and infrastructure usage. However, most existing municipal networks still depend heavily on IPv4, which faces serious address limitations and lacks native support for large-scale IoT deployments. This project aims to design a smart city network in Cisco Packet Tracer using IPv6 for virtually unlimited addressing and Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing critical emergency traffic.

The proposed network will illustrate how these technologies can improve the reliability, scalability, and responsiveness of city-wide sensor systems, especially under failure scenarios. Current IPv4 constraints—such as address exhaustion requiring complex NAT configurations and limited IoT integration—will be overcome by our hierarchical IPv6 architecture.

\section*{Objectives}
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=2.\arabic*, nosep]
    \item Design a scalable smart city network in Cisco Packet Tracer with access, distribution, and core layers
    \item Implement IPv6 across all segments to remove address exhaustion issues
    \item Configure Quality of Service to guarantee priority for emergency traffic
    \item Separate IoT, public Wi-Fi, and administrative devices using VLANs and ACLs
    \item Create automated email alerts through SMTP for critical network events
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Scope}
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Scope}
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and testing of a smart city IoT network prototype in Cisco Packet Tracer. It covers:

    \item A robust three-tier network architecture with structured IPv6 addressing
    \item Security enforcement through VLAN segmentation and ACL policies
    \item Deployment of basic network services (SMTP, HTTP) to support system monitoring
    \item Simulation of multiple IoT devices, including traffic sensors, air quality monitors, and smart waste bins
    \item Failover validation and QoS performance testing for critical traffic
\end{itemize}

Physical installation details, advanced encryption frameworks, large-scale application development, and deep real-time analytics platforms are excluded to keep the scope focused on essential networking concepts.

\section*{Limitations}
\phantomsection
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Simulation constraints:} Packet Tracer cannot perfectly replicate all real-world network conditions
    \item \textbf{Scale:} Limited to 15–20 devices compared to the thousands used in real cities
    \item \textbf{Wireless:} Unable to model actual interference and signal propagation complexities
    \item \textbf{Services:} Basic SMTP and HTTP functionality compared to production-grade platforms

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}
This project addresses key networking challenges faced by modern smart cities through an IPv6-based IoT network design enhanced with QoS capabilities. The simulation showcases practical solutions for address exhaustion, prioritized traffic handling, and improved network resilience. By combining existing standards with thoughtful architecture, we present a blueprint for building efficient municipal sensor networks that enhance operational efficiency and emergency responsiveness.

The technical skills gained, along with the documented best practices, will be valuable for future deployments. While simulation limitations exist, the demonstrated concepts and configurations are directly applicable to larger-scale, production-grade smart city environments.
